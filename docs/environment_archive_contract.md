# Remote environment archive contract

`topcoffea.modules.remote_environment` is the source authority for resolving,
fingerprinting, building, caching, and validating analysis archives used by
remote executors. Typed source signatures and returned dictionaries remain
authoritative.

## Public workflow

The maintained caller normally uses `get_environment(...)`:

```python
from topcoffea.modules.remote_environment import get_environment

archive_path = get_environment(unstaged="rebuild", cache_size=3)
```

It resolves the current request, derives a fingerprint-named path, validates
any cache hit and adjacent manifest, builds only when necessary, writes a fresh
manifest atomically, and trims older cache entries. Environment creation uses
`poncho_package_create`; callers should use the higher-level topeft CLI instead
of private builders.

| Fully qualified name | Signature and result | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `topcoffea.modules.remote_environment.resolve_environment_request` | `(extra_conda=None, extra_pip=None, extra_pip_local=None, unstaged="rebuild") -> dict` | Resolves/sanitizes the conda/pip request and editable-package state. `unstaged` is `rebuild` or `fail`. |
| `topcoffea.modules.remote_environment.environment_archive_path` | `(environment_fingerprint: str) -> str` | Returns `topeft-envs/env_spec_<first-16-hex>.tar.gz` under the cache root. |
| `topcoffea.modules.remote_environment.write_archive_manifest` | `(archive_path: str, environment_request: dict) -> str` | Hashes an existing archive and atomically writes its adjacent `.manifest.json`. |
| `topcoffea.modules.remote_environment.validate_environment_archive` | `(archive_path: str, current_environment_request=None, snapshot=False) -> dict` | Validates regular-file/tar integrity, manifest schema/fields, archive hash, and optionally current provenance. |
| `topcoffea.modules.remote_environment.get_environment` | `(extra_conda=None, extra_pip=None, extra_pip_local=None, force=False, unstaged="rebuild", cache_size=3) -> str` | Returns a current validated archive path, rebuilding only the resolved cache key. |

`UnstagedChanges` is raised when `unstaged="fail"` and a watched editable
package has tracked changes.

## Fingerprint inputs

The environment fingerprint is a SHA-256 digest of the running Python version,
the sanitized resolved conda/pip specification, and each watched editable
package's name, Git commit, watched-source fingerprint, clean/dirty state, and
relevant untracked-file evidence.

`pip_local_to_watch` currently watches `topcoffea` paths `topcoffea` and
`setup.py`. Tracked contents and status under those paths contribute to the
source fingerprint. Non-ignored untracked regular files contribute sorted
path/SHA-256 pairs and a separate count/fingerprint. Symlink or non-regular
untracked watched entries fail closed.

Changing the watch set is a compatibility decision: update
`pip_local_to_watch`, validate clean/dirty/untracked behavior, and update
`tests/test_remote_environment.py`. Do not add a second cache registry in a
consumer.

## Manifest schema

`MANIFEST_SCHEMA_VERSION` is currently `1`. The adjacent manifest contains
`schema_version`, archive basename/SHA-256, creation time, environment and
resolved-spec fingerprints, Python version, resolved spec, editable-package
states, and builder identity. It is written to a same-directory temporary file,
flushed/fsynced, and published with `os.replace`.

Archive existence without a readable matching manifest is not a current
validated cache hit.

## Strict and snapshot validation

Strict validation requires a readable non-empty tar.gz, a supported complete
manifest, matching basename/hash, and—when a current request is supplied—the
same environment fingerprint. A valid result has `status="valid"` and
`usable=True`.

`snapshot=True` relaxes only current-provenance compatibility for an explicitly
selected historical archive. It never relaxes tar integrity, archive digest,
basename, or unsupported-schema checks. A missing/incomplete manifest may be
reported as `unverifiable` but explicitly usable with warnings in snapshot
mode; an invalid archive remains unusable.

Important status values are `valid`, `stale`, `unverifiable`, and
`invalid_archive`. Callers must inspect `usable`, `mismatches`, `warnings`, and
`provenance_status`.

## Cache and rebuild behavior

Archive names use the first 16 hex characters of the full fingerprint. A cache
entry is reused only after strict validation. `force=True` rebuilds the resolved
key. Dirty watched sources with `unstaged="rebuild"` change the fingerprint and
select a distinct archive rather than overwriting a clean entry. `cache_size`
controls trimming after a successful build; the archive just created is
protected.

Do not modify manifests or archives in place. After changing package inputs or
watched source, resolve a new request and let `get_environment` choose the new
key. Package installation is an operational action outside this reference.
